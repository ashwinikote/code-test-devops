Ravelin Code Test For DevOps
============================

## Intructions
- Work through the questions, in order.
- Please do not spend more than 40 mins on any one problem.
- Spend a maximum of 3 hours on the test.
- Once you have completed the test please submit a readme. Ensure to include the IP address of the server and a readme of the things you tried for each question, even if you were unable to solve the problem.
- Do not change the log destination of rsyslog or nginx.

## Setup
- Provide your GCP email address to Ravelin
â€“ install the GCP gcloud tool `https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/` 
- Check you have access to the image by running `gcloud compute images list --project ravelin-code-test`
- Create a new micro instance with:
```
gcloud compute instances create MY-INSTANCE --project MY-PROJECT --image ravelin-code-test-image --image-project ravelin-code-test1 --zone us-east1-b --machine-type f1-micro
```
- You will need to enable HTTPS traffic via the https://console.cloud.google.com/ by editing the instance.

## Problems
1. Nginx has been configured by a developer; however, it seems to be broken. Please ssh into the box and fix the issue. It is suppose to serving https from the machine's IP address.

2. The application is failing to connect to api.ravelin.com. e.g. `curl https://api.ravelin.com` but it seems to be working from the developers local code and machine. Please ssh into the box and has a look and fix.

3. Please add the user `ravelin` as a root user, without a password but with the below public key as authentication.
```ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDywrXuIj6+WlhM4Us9te1YLQAlsp3sPKtiRCt2DJf27zQ2Ig5YWLUZT+QMzWrcPK8ZjT/GspLgpwM

```

4. This particular server seems to have higer CPU utilisation and is affecting performance. It can't be the application as it is running ok on other servers. Please fix.

5. A developer is working remotely from Tuvalu; however, is unable to gain SSH access. Please can you find the problem and fix it for them.

6. Similarly to the problem connecting to api.ravelin.com, the application cannot connect to `https://api.github.com/`. Please see if you can fix this.
